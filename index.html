Other than internal TV slides and emails, what are some other ways that messages can be internally communicated to employees to help remind them of things?

ChatGPT said:
If internal TV slides and email are already in play, the next step is meeting employees where their attention already is—and varying the channel so reminders don’t fade into background noise. Here are the most effective alternatives, grouped by how and when people actually notice them.

1. Chat & Collaboration Tools (high visibility, fast)
If your company uses chat daily, this is prime real estate.

Pinned posts / channel topics in Slack or Microsoft Teams

Scheduled reminder bots (weekly safety reminder, monthly deadline ping)

Read-only announcement channels (prevents chatter burying the message)

Short recurring nudges instead of long posts (people actually read these)

Why it works: Employees already check chat dozens of times a day.

2. Physical Environment (low-tech, high recall)
Digital isn’t always best—physical cues stick surprisingly well.

Posters or signage near time clocks, break rooms, bathrooms

Table tents or desk cards for temporary reminders

Floor decals or wall stickers for safety/process reminders

Whiteboards with rotating “This Week’s Reminder”

Why it works: You catch people mid-routine, not mid-task.

3. Manager-Led Reinforcement (most powerful)
Nothing beats a human repeating the message.

30-second reminder in daily standups

Weekly talking points given to managers

“One reminder per meeting” rule (keeps it lightweight)

Managers acknowledge compliance publicly (“Good catches this week on X”)

Why it works: Repetition + authority = retention.

4. Knowledge Base & Process Hubs (reference, not reminder)
These don’t push reminders, but they anchor them.

Highlighted banners in Confluence, SharePoint, or Notion

“What changed this month” sections

Required acknowledgment checkboxes for critical updates

Why it works: Employees trust these as the source of truth.

5. Workflow-Embedded Nudges (best for compliance)
Reminders that appear only when relevant.

Pop-ups in internal tools at the moment of action

Mandatory confirmation steps (“Did you remember to…?”)

Checklist gates before task completion (Jira, internal apps)

Why it works: Zero reliance on memory.

6. SMS / Push Notifications (use sparingly)
For urgent or time-sensitive reminders.

Shift changes

Safety alerts

Deadline-day nudges

Why it works: Impossible to ignore—but overuse kills trust.

7. Culture-Based Reminders (long-term payoff)
Make the reminder part of identity, not noise.

Internal slogans or mascots

Recognition programs tied to the behavior

Monthly “mistake of the month” learning moments

Internal social posts via Viva Engage (formerly Yammer)

Why it works: People remember stories more than rules.

Practical Rule of Thumb
If it’s:

Critical → Embed it in workflow

Routine → Manager + chat reminder

Behavioral → Physical + cultural reinforcement

Urgent → SMS / push only

If you want, tell me:

Company size

Office vs warehouse vs remote

Type of reminders (safety, IT, HR, ops)

…and I’ll design a low-annoyance internal reminder system that actually sticks.


You said:
How do you embed a pop-up into people's sign in or something else?

ChatGPT said:
You embed pop-ups at sign-in by hooking into the authentication flow or the first app people hit after auth. There are a few real ways companies do this—some clean, some hacky, some very powerful. I’ll walk you through them from most correct to most pragmatic.

1. Identity Provider (IdP) Login Interstitials
Best, cleanest, enterprise-grade


https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/4pa532TumNn6TI3gQmMWEw/0a6182b447b75b24bea1b763c1ba73a1/non-sso-scenario

If your company uses SSO, this is the gold standard.

Platforms that support this
Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)

Okta

Google Workspace

Ping Identity

How it works
User enters username/password

Before they reach any app, they see:

A pop-up / page

Policy notice

Acknowledgment checkbox

They must acknowledge to continue

What you can show
Security reminders (“External sharing policy changed”)

IT notices

Mandatory acknowledgements

Training confirmations

Technical mechanisms
Conditional Access policies

Custom authentication flows

Post-login interstitial pages

Forced “Accept” before token issuance

✅ Best for compliance
❌ Requires IT/IdP admin access

2. Application-Level Post-Login Modals
Most common + easiest

https://cdn.dribbble.com/userupload/4088007/file/original-7cae8d1ec910cc82573ec4ddbe2ef0ef.png?format=webp&resize=400x300&vertical=center

https://resourcecenter.maxwellhealth.com/hc/article_attachments/360057075413
This is what most internal tools actually do.

How it works
User signs in normally

App checks:

Has user acknowledged message X?

Is this message still active?

If not → modal blocks the UI

Implementation logic (conceptual)
onLogin():
  if user.hasNotAcknowledged("policy_2026_02"):
      showBlockingModal()
Where this is used
Internal dashboards

HR portals

IT portals

Custom tools

Best practices
Full-screen or blocking modal (not dismissible)

“Acknowledge” button stored server-side

Versioned messages (don’t re-show old ones)

✅ Easy to build
✅ Fully customizable
❌ Only appears after login

3. Forced Landing Page (Redirect Gate)
Very effective, very simple


https://community.f5.com/t5/s/zihoc95639/attachments/zihoc95639/TechnicalForum/270264/1/domain.com_landing%20page.png

https://desk.zoho.in/galleryDocuments/edbsn77ddac956374b268baeddcaded14c0e17e939cd7a617e34f78b4bcbd87f7d0649282ecf0b2d68d24bf593e744fb01da3c23965f55f1c70e25690c1d1f56c2e5f?inline=true
Instead of a pop-up, you redirect users.

Flow
Login → redirect to /notice

User must click “Continue”

Only then do they reach /dashboard

Why this works
No JavaScript trickery

No modal bugs

Impossible to ignore

This is extremely common in:

Banks

Universities

Government systems

4. Endpoint-Level Login Messages (OS login)
Blunt instrument, but unavoidable

https://mewbies.com/motd_images/mewbies_best_motd_in_color.png
This shows messages before users even reach their desktop.

Examples
Windows: “Legal Notice” before login

macOS: Login window banners

Linux: /etc/motd

Use cases
Legal disclaimers

Security warnings

Breach notifications

⚠️ Do not overuse — users become blind to it fast

5. Microsoft 365 / Workspace Soft Gates
Lightweight, familiar

If most work happens in:

Microsoft Teams

SharePoint

Slack

You can:

Force users into a landing channel

Use persistent banners

Require click-through acknowledgments

Not true login pop-ups—but practically effective.

6. Browser Extension Injection (Advanced / niche)
Powerful but risky

Company-managed browser extension

Injects modal on first intranet page load

Common in call centers & regulated environments

❌ High maintenance
❌ Can feel invasive
✅ Extremely targeted

What I’d Recommend (Real Talk)
If you want something that:

Actually works

Is defensible to auditors

Doesn’t annoy employees

Ranked choice

IdP login interstitial (if you have Entra / Okta)

Forced landing page after login

Blocking modal on first app load

Avoid:

Non-blocking pop-ups

Email-only acknowledgements

“FYI” banners for critical info

If you want, tell me:

What IdP you’re using

Whether apps are web, desktop, or mobile

Whether this is policy, security, or operational

I’ll give you an exact implementation plan (including config steps or code patterns).


You said:
So for a WIndows Office type machine and everything, what would be simplest so the first time someone logs in during the day a little close-able pop-up window witht the message comes in and then can be dismissed

ChatGPT said:
Simplest on a Windows + Microsoft 365 type setup: show it at user logon using a Scheduled Task + a small popup script. That gives you exactly “first login of the day → closable message → dismiss” without building an app or touching SSO.

Here are the two clean options—pick based on what you have.

Option A (most common): Scheduled Task at logon + PowerShell toast
What it does: When a user logs in, a toast notification pops. User can dismiss it.
Pros: Very simple, deployable via GPO/Intune, doesn’t interrupt work.
Con: Some toasts aren’t “modal” (they can ignore it). Still dismissible.

How it’s done (high level):

Deploy a script to C:\ProgramData\Company\DailyNotice.ps1

Create a Scheduled Task:

Trigger: At log on (Any user)

Action: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ...

Script checks a “last shown” stamp (per-user), and only shows once per day.

The “once per day” trick: store a date file in:

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Company\notice_last_shown.txt

Option B (more “pop-up window”): Scheduled Task + message box
What it does: A real pop-up window appears (closable).
Pros: Feels like an actual pop-up; harder to miss.
Cons: Can be annoying if it interrupts; message box can land behind other windows sometimes.

Same deployment approach, but instead of toast you call a simple message box.

If you’re using Intune (recommended deployment path)
Intune: deploy script + create scheduled task (or use proactive remediations)

GPO (on-prem AD): computer/user logon script + scheduled task preference

Practical recommendation (what I’d do)
For “reminder” stuff (parking, small policy reminders, daily notes): Option A (toast).

For “must-see” stuff (security incident, urgent policy, don’t ignore): Option B (message box), but keep it short.

If you tell me which you have—Intune, Group Policy, or neither—I’ll drop in the exact ready-to-deploy script + the exact Scheduled Task command/settings (no guesswork).
